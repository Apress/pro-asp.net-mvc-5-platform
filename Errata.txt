1. Page 32, Table 3-5: Under AuthorizeRequest should be PostAuthorizeRequest. It's mentioned in the Description column, but is missing from the Name one.

2. Page 33, Table 3-5: Between PreSendRequestHeaders and PreSendRequestContent should be an empty line in order to be correctly aligned with the corresponding description.

3. Page 73, Section "Understanding the Built-in Modules", in the paragraph after Listing 4-9: "... the module objects returned by the HttpApplication.Module property." should be "... the module objects returned by the HttpApplication.Modules property.".

4. Page 81, Section "Understanding Handlers in the Request Life Cycle", in the second paragraph, second phrase (typo): "They can be used flor diagnosis and debugging..." should be "They can be used for diagnosis and debugging...".

5. Page 82, Section "Understanding Handlers in the Request Life Cycle", in the paragraph before Figure 5.3 (typo): "In figure 5-1, I have shown the MVC programmer's view..." should be (I suppose) "In figure 5-2, I have shown the MVC programmer's view...".


6. Page 84, Section "Handlers and the Life-Cycle Events", in the first paragraph (typo): "In Figure 5-3, I explained..." should be (I suppose) "In Figure 5-4, I explained...".

7. Page 85, Section "Registering a Handler Using URL Routing", in the first paragraph, the second phrase (typo): "The firs technique for registering..." should be "The first technique for registering...".

8. Page 105, Section "Preparing the Example Project", in the first paragraph (typo): "... and set the name of the project to Request" should be "... and set the name of the project to RequestFlow".

9. Page 125, Section "Handling Error Notifications", in the note after the Listing 6-15 (typo): "The HandleEvent method uses the HttpContect.CurrentNotification property..." should be "The HandleEvent method uses the HttpContext.CurrentNotification property...".

10. Page 136, Section "Getting Device Capabilities", Listing 7-5: first code line, "@model IEnumerable<Tuple<string, string>>", is not necessary (@Model is not used anywhere in the view).

11. Page 155, Section "Using Partial Views", Listing 7-16 and the paragraph above: The suggested name for the partial view is Programmers.Safari.cshtml, which fails, because it contains ".", which appears to be an illegal character for a view (file) name. Anyway, I used a valid name and after that I managed to change the name to the suggested value. Please note that I used Visual Studio 2015.

12. Page 209, Section "Using the Location Element", at the end of the paragraph before Listing 9-24 (typo): "...3as shown in Listing 9-24." should be "...3as shown in Listing 9-24.".

13. Page 239, Section "Demonstration the problem", within Listing 10-16: $("#msgTable tbody").append("<tr><td>" + data + "</th></tr>") should be $("#msgTable tbody").append("<tr><td>" + data + "</td></tr>").

14. Page 246, Section "Storing Session Data", Table 10-10: I think that within the description for StateServer, instead of 'See the "Using a SQL Database" section.' should be 'See the "Using the State Server" section.'

15. Page 247, Section "Using the State Server", within the paragraph under the Listing 10-20 (typo): "stateConnetionString" should be "stateConnectionString".

16. Page 254, Section "Using Base Caching", Listing 11-1: PopulateCache is failing because the Apress website is HTTPS now. The error I got is "The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel.". To fix it, I added the next line as the first in the PopulateCache method: "ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12;".

17. Page 265, Section "Depending on another Cached Item", within the last phrase in the first paragraph (logic): "... I have added a new action method to the Cache controller, as shown in Listing 11-7.". Listing 11-7 doesn't contain a new action method, but a new cached item. So I think that the correct phrase would be "... I have added a new cached item, as shown in Listing 11-7.".

18. Page 270, Section "Receiving Dependency Notifications", within the last paragraph: "... navigate to Cache/Item..." should be "... navigate to Cache/Index...".

19. Page 305, Section "Creating the User Class", within the paragraph before Listing 13-5 (typo): "... I created a class file called AppUserModels.cs..." should be "... I created a class file called AppUser.cs...".

20. Page 309, Section "Using ASP.NET Identity", the title for Table 13-4 (typo): "Putting Content Caching by Attribute in Context" should be "Putting ASP.NET Identity in Context".

21. Page 310, Section "Creating the View", Listing 13-24 (code): The validation summary code is missing: "@Html.ValidationSummary(false)". Maybe before "@using (Html.BeginForm())"?

22. Page 337-338, Section "Preparing to Implement Authentication", Listing 14-3 (code): "if (ModelState.IsValid) { }" should be moved from the GET Login action to the POST one. In Listing 14-5 (page 340) this is correctly implemented.

23. Page 347, Section "Creating and deleting roles", Listing 14-9, within HttpPost Create action: "return View(name);" should be "return View((object)name);". View(string) is showing the view with the name specified specified as parameter; here we need the overload View(object), where the parameter is the model passed to the view.
